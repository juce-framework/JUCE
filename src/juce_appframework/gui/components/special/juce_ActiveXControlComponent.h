/**
    A Windows-specific class that can create and embed an ActiveX control inside
    itself.

    To use it, create one of these, put it in place and make sure it's visible in a
    window, then use createControl() to instantiate an ActiveX control. The control
    will then be moved and resized to follow the movements of this component.

    Of course, since the control is a heavyweight window, it'll obliterate any
    juce components that may overlap this component, but that's life.

        The peer controlIID is a pointer to an IID structure - it's treated
        as a void* because when including the Juce headers, you might not always
        have included windows.h first, in which case IID wouldn't be defined.

        e.g. @code
        const IID myIID = __uuidof (QTControl);
        myControlComp->createControl (&myIID);
        @endcode

        This allows you to cast the control to whatever type of COM object you need.

        The iid parameter is a pointer to an IID structure - it's treated
        as a void* because when including the Juce headers, you might not always
        have included windows.h first, in which case IID wouldn't be defined, but
        you should just pass a pointer to an IID.

        e.g. @code
        const IID iid = __uuidof (IOleWindow);

        IOleWindow* oleWindow = (IOleWindow*) myControlComp->queryInterface (&iid);

        if (oleWindow != 0)
