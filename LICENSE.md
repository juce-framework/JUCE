JUCE has tier-leveled license terms, with different terms for each available
license: JUCE Personal (for developers or startup businesses with revenue under
the 50K USD Revenue Limit; free), JUCE Indie (for small businesses with under
500K USD Revenue Limit; $40/month), JUCE Pro (no Revenue Limit; $130/month),
and JUCE Educational (no Revenue Limit; free for bona fide educational
institutions). All licenses allow you to commercially release applications as
long as you do not exceed the Revenue Limit and pay the applicable Fees. Once
your business hits the Revenue Limit for your JUCE license tier, to continue
distributing your Applications you will either have to upgrade your JUCE 
license, or instead release your Applications under the
[GNU General Public License v.3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html),
which means, amongst other things, that you must make the source code of your
Applications available.
