/*  If the provided ARAFactory is not yet in use it constructs a new shared_ptr that will call the
    provided onDelete function inside the custom deleter of this new shared_ptr instance.

    The onDelete function is responsible for releasing the resources that guarantee the validity of
    the wrapped ARAFactory*.

    If however the ARAFactory is already in use the function will just return a copy of the already
    existing shared_ptr and call the onDelete function immediately. This is to ensure that the
    ARAFactory is only uninitialised when no plugin instance can be using it.

    On both platforms the onDelete function is used to release resources that ensure that the module
    providing the ARAFactory* remains loaded.
