	lv2:documentation """

<span class="warning">This extension is deprecated.</span> New implementations
should use <a href="atom.html">LV2 Atom</a> instead.

This extension defines a generic time-stamped event port type, which can be
used to create plugins that read and write real-time events, such as MIDI,
OSC, or any other type of event payload.  The type(s) of event supported by
a port is defined in the data file for a plugin, for example:

    :::turtle
    <http://example.org/some-plugin>
        lv2:port [
            a ev:EventPort, lv2:InputPort ;
            lv2:index 0 ;
            ev:supportsEvent <http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/midi#MidiEvent> ;
            lv2:symbol "midi_input" ;
            lv2:name "MIDI input" ;
        ] .

"""^^lv2:Markdown .

ev:EventPort
	lv2:documentation """

Ports of this type will be connected to a struct of type LV2_Event_Buffer,
defined in event.h.  These ports contain a sequence of generic events (possibly
several types mixed in a single stream), the specific types of which are
defined by some URI in another LV2 extension.

"""^^lv2:Markdown .

ev:Event
	a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:label "Event" ;
	lv2:documentation """

An ev:EventPort contains an LV2_Event_Buffer which contains a sequence of these
events.  The binary format of LV2 events is defined by the LV2_Event struct in
event.h.

Specific event types (such as MIDI or OSC) are defined by extensions, and
should be rdfs:subClassOf this class.

"""^^lv2:Markdown .

ev:TimeStamp
	lv2:documentation """

This defines the meaning of the 'frames' and 'subframes' fields of an LV2_Event
(both unsigned 32-bit integers).

"""^^lv2:Markdown .

ev:FrameStamp
	lv2:documentation """

The default time stamp unit for an LV2 event: the frames field represents audio
frames (in the sample rate passed to intantiate), and the subframes field is
1/UINT32_MAX of a frame.

"""^^lv2:Markdown .

ev:generic
	lv2:documentation """

Indicates that this port does something meaningful for any event type.  This is
useful for things like event mixers, delays, serialisers, and so on.

If this property is set, hosts should consider the port suitable for any type
of event.  Otherwise, hosts should consider the port 'appropriate' only for the
specific event types listed with :supportsEvent.  Note that plugins must
gracefully handle unknown event types whether or not this property is present.

"""^^lv2:Markdown .

ev:supportsEvent
	lv2:documentation """

Indicates that this port supports or "understands" a certain event type.

For input ports, this means the plugin understands and does something useful
with events of this type.  For output ports, this means the plugin may generate
events of this type.  If the plugin never actually generates events of this
type, but might pass them through from an input, this property should not be
set (use ev:inheritsEvent for that).

Plugins with event input ports must always gracefully handle any type of event,
even if it does not 'support' it.  This property should always be set for event
types the plugin understands/generates so hosts can discover plugins
appropriate for a given scenario (for example, plugins with a MIDI input).
Hosts are not expected to consider event ports suitable for some type of event
if the relevant :supportsEvent property is not set, unless the ev:generic
property for that port is also set.


"""^^lv2:Markdown .

ev:inheritsEvent
	lv2:documentation """

Indicates that this output port might pass through events that arrived at some
other input port (or generate an event of the same type as events arriving at
that input).  The host must always check the stamp type of all outputs when
connecting an input, but this property should be set whenever it applies.


"""^^lv2:Markdown .

ev:supportsTimeStamp
	lv2:documentation """

Indicates that this port supports or "understands" a certain time stamp type.
Meaningful only for input ports, the host must never connect a port to an event
buffer with a time stamp type that isn't supported by the port.

"""^^lv2:Markdown .

ev:generatesTimeStamp
	lv2:documentation """

Indicates that this port may output a certain time stamp type, regardless of
the time stamp type of any input ports.

If the port outputs stamps based on what type inputs are connected to, this
property should not be set (use the ev:inheritsTimeStamp property for that).
Hosts MUST check the time_stamp value of any output port buffers after a call
to connect_port on ANY event input port on the plugin.

If the plugin changes the stamp_type field of an output event buffer during a
call to run(), the plugin must call the stamp_type_changed function provided by
the host in the LV2_Event_Feature struct, if it is non-NULL.

"""^^lv2:Markdown .

ev:inheritsTimeStamp
	lv2:documentation """

Indicates that this port follows the time stamp type of an input port.

This property is not necessary, but it should be set for outputs that base
their output type on an input port so the host can make more sense of the
plugin and provide a more sensible interface.
