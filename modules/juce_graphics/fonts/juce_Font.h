        When the font size is specified in points (using setPointHeight(),

        to the font's size in points multiplied by the override value. That is, if the font size

        When the font size is *not* specified in points (using setHeight(),

        The ascent override still specifies the size of the font's ascender as a proportion of the
        font's em size.
        However, the point size of the font is now found by multiplying the JUCE height by the
        height-to-point factor, where this factor is equal to
        (1.0f / (ascent-in-em-units + descent-in-em-units)).

        descent override is 0.5f, then the font size will be 14pt and the ascent will be 7pt.
        Changing the ascent override to 1.0f and the descent override to 0.0f will preserve the
        font size of 14pt but give an ascender of 14pt and a descender of 0pt.
        Changing the ascent and descent overrides both to 1.0f will result in the

        characters such as combining marks and variation selectors into account when
