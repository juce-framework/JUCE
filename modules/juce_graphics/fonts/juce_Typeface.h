    In new projects, it's recommended to use the 'portable' metrics kind, so that fonts display
    at a similar size on all platforms.
    Portable metrics are enabled by default when constructing a Font using FontOptions. The old,
    deprecated Font constructors will all request the legacy metrics kind instead.
    JUCE components that display text will query LookAndFeel::getDefaultMetricsKind() to find the
    kind of metrics that should be used. This function can be overridden to switch the metrics kind
    for the entire LookAndFeel.

    The 'legacy' metrics kind uses the platform font facilities to retrieve font metrics.
    Each platform has its own idiosyncratic behaviour when computing metrics - depending on the
    typeface data, it's possible that the 'portable' metrics will differ from the 'legacy' metrics
    on every platform. The biggest differences between legacy and portable metrics are likely to be
    seen on Windows, so it may be helpful to check this platform first.

        NOTE: The metrics of the system typeface may be significantly different from the metrics of
        the sans-serif font that JUCE would normally select to be the default font. This is
        especially evident on Windows: For Segoe UI (the Windows system typeface)
        the sum of ascender and descender is somewhat larger than the em-size of the font,
        but for Verdana (the JUCE default sans-serif font on Windows) the sum of ascender and
        descender is closer to the em-size. When the size of a font is set via
        FontOptions::withHeight() or Font::setHeight(), JUCE will scale fonts based on the sum of
        ascender and descender, so switching to Segoe UI might cause text to render at a much
        smaller size than with Verdana. You may get better results by setting font sizes in points
        using FontOptions::withFontHeight() and Font::setPointHeight(). When using points, Segoe UI
        still renders slightly smaller than Verdana, but the differences are less pronounced.
