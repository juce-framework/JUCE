/** Singleton class responsible for push notifications functionality. Both remote and
    local notifications are supported. To get information about notifications,
    register a listener on your application startup. It is best to register the
    listener as soon as possible, because your application can be launched from
    a push notification too.

    To send a local notification create an instance of Notification, fill the necessary
    fields and call PushNotifications::sendLocalNotification(). When receiving local or
    remote notifications, inspect the Notification's fields for notification details.
    Bear in mind that some fields will not be available when receiving a remote
    notification.
