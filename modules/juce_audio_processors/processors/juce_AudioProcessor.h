    Base class for audio processing classes or plugins.

    This is intended to act as a base class of audio processor that is general enough
    to be wrapped as a VST, AU, AAX, etc, or used internally.

    It is also used by the plugin hosting code as the wrapper around an instance
    of a loaded plugin.

    You should derive your own class from this base class, and if you're building a
    plugin, you should implement a global function called createPluginFilter() which
    creates and returns a new instance of your subclass.

        When this method is called, the buffer contains a number of channels which is
        at least as great as the maximum number of input and output channels that
        this processor is using. It will be filled with the processor's input data and
        should be replaced with the processor's output.

        So for example if your processor has a total of 2 input channels and 4 output
        channels, then the buffer will contain 4 channels, the first two being filled
        with the input data. Your processor should read these, do its processing, and
        replace the contents of all 4 channels with its output.

        Or if your processor has a total of 5 inputs and 2 outputs, the buffer will have 5
        channels, all filled with data, and your processor should overwrite the first 2 of
        these with its output. But be VERY careful not to write anything to the last 3
        channels, as these might be mapped to memory that the host assumes is read-only!

        If your plug-in has more than one input or output buses then the buffer passed
        to the processBlock methods will contain a bundle of all channels of each bus.
        Use getBusBuffer to obtain an audio buffer for a particular bus.

        Note that if you have more outputs than inputs, then only those channels that
        correspond to an input channel are guaranteed to contain sensible data - e.g.
        in the case of 2 inputs and 4 outputs, the first two channels contain the input,
        but the last two channels may contain garbage, so you should be careful not to
        let this pass through without being overwritten or cleared.

        Also note that the buffer may have more channels than are strictly necessary,
        but you should only read/write from the ones that your processor is supposed to
        be using.

        The number of samples in these buffers is NOT guaranteed to be the same for every
        callback, and may be more or less than the estimated value given to prepareToPlay().
        Your code must be able to cope with variable-sized blocks, or you're going to get
        clicks and crashes!

        Also note that some hosts will occasionally decide to pass a buffer containing
        zero samples, so make sure that your algorithm can deal with that!

        If the processor is receiving a MIDI input, then the midiMessages array will be filled
        with the MIDI messages for this block. Each message's timestamp will indicate the
        message's time, as a number of samples from the start of the block.

        Any messages left in the MIDI buffer when this method has finished are assumed to
        be the processor's MIDI output. This means that your processor should be careful to
        clear any incoming messages from the array if it doesn't want them to be passed-on.

        If you have implemented the getBypassParameter method, then you need to check the
        value of this parameter in this callback and bypass your processing if the parameter
        has a non-zero value.

        Note that when calling this method as a host, the result may still be bypassed as
        the parameter that controls the bypass may be non-zero.

        Be very careful about what you do in this callback - it's going to be called by
        the audio thread, so any kind of interaction with the UI is absolutely
        out of the question. If you change a parameter in here and need to tell your UI to
        update itself, the best way is probably to inherit from a ChangeBroadcaster, let
        the UI components register as listeners, and then call sendChangeMessage() inside the
        processBlock() method to send out an asynchronous message. You could also use
        the AsyncUpdater class in a similar way.

        should be replaced with the processor's output.

        So for example if your processor has a combined total of 2 input channels and
        4 output channels, then the buffer will contain 4 channels, the first two
        being filled with the input data. Your processor should read these, do its

        channels correspond to which of the buses.
