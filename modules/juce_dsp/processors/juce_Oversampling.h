/**
    A processor that performs multi-channel oversampling.

    This class can be configured to do a factor of 2, 4, 8 or 16 times
    oversampling, using multiple stages, with polyphase allpass IIR filters or FIR
    filters, and latency compensation.

    The principle of oversampling is to increase the sample rate of a given
    non-linear process to prevent it from creating aliasing. Oversampling works
    by upsampling the input signal N times, processing the upsampled signal
    with the increased internal sample rate, then downsampling the result to get
    back to the original sample rate.

    Choose between FIR or IIR filtering depending on your needs in terms of
    latency and phase distortion. With FIR filters the phase is linear but the
    latency is maximised. With IIR filtering the phase is compromised around the
    Nyquist frequency but the latency is minimised.

    @see FilterDesign.
