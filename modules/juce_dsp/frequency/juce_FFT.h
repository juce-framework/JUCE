    Performs a fast fourier transform.

    This is only a simple low-footprint implementation and isn't tuned for speed - it may
    be useful for simple applications where one of the more complex FFT libraries would be
    overkill. (But in the future it may end up becoming optimised of course...)

    The FFT class itself contains lookup tables, so there's some overhead in creating
    one, you should create and cache an FFT object for each size/direction of transform
    that you need, and re-use them to perform the actual operation.

        As the coefficients of the negative frequencies (frequencies higher than
        N/2 or pi) are the complex conjugate of their positive counterparts,
        it may not be necessary to calculate them for your particular application.
        You can use onlyCalculateNonNegativeFrequencies to let the FFT
        engine know that you do not plan on using them. Note that this is only a
        hint: some FFT engines (currently only the Fallback engine), will still
        calculate the negative frequencies even if onlyCalculateNonNegativeFrequencies
        is true.

        should contain your raw input sample data. On return, if

        complex real + imaginary parts data interleaved. If
        onlyCalculateNonNegativeFrequencies is true, the array will contain at least
