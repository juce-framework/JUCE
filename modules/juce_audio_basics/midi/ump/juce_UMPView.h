    Points to a single Universal MIDI Packet.

    The packet must be well-formed for member functions to work correctly.

    Specifically, the constructor argument must be the beginning of a region of
    uint32_t that contains at least `getNumWordsForMessageType (*data)` items,
    where `data` is the constructor argument.

    NOTE: Instances of this class do not own the memory that they point to!
    If you need to store a packet pointed-to by a View for later use, copy
    the view contents to a Packets collection, or use the Utils::PacketX types.
