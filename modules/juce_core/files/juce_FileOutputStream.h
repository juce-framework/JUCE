        If the file doesn't exist, it will first be created. If the file can't be
        created or opened (for example, because the parent directory of the file
        does not exist), the failedToOpen() method will return true.

        If the file already exists when opened, the stream's write-position will
        be set to the end of the file. To overwrite an existing file, you can truncate
        it like this:

        @code
        FileOutputStream stream (file);

        if (stream.openedOk())
        {
            stream.setPosition (0);
            stream.truncate();
            ...
        }
        @endcode


        Destroying a FileOutputStream object does not force the operating system
        to write the buffered data to disk immediately. If this is required you
        should call flush() before triggering the destructor.
