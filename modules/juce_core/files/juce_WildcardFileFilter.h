        Creates a wildcard filter for one or more patterns.

        The wildcardPatterns parameter is a comma or semicolon-delimited set of
        patterns, e.g. "*.wav;*.aiff" would look for files ending in either .wav
        or .aiff.

        Passing an empty string as a pattern will fail to match anything, so by leaving
        either the file or directory pattern parameter empty means you can control
        whether files or directories are found.

        The description is a name to show the user in a list of possible patterns, so
        for the wav/aiff example, your description might be "audio files".
