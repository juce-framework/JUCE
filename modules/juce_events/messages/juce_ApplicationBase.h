/**
    Abstract base class for application classes.

    Note that in the juce_gui_basics module, there's a utility class JUCEApplication
    which derives from JUCEApplicationBase, and takes care of a few chores. Most
    of the time you'll want to derive your class from JUCEApplication rather than
    using JUCEApplicationBase directly, but if you're not using the juce_gui_basics
    module then you might need to go straight to this base class.

    Any application that wants to run an event loop must declare a subclass of
    JUCEApplicationBase, and implement its various pure virtual methods.

    It then needs to use the START_JUCE_APPLICATION macro somewhere in a CPP file
    to declare an instance of this class and generate suitable platform-specific
    boilerplate code to launch the app.

    e.g. @code
        class MyJUCEApp  : public JUCEApplication
        {
        public:
            MyJUCEApp()  {}
            ~MyJUCEApp() {}

            void initialise (const String& commandLine) override
            {
                myMainWindow.reset (new MyApplicationWindow());
                myMainWindow->setBounds (100, 100, 400, 500);
                myMainWindow->setVisible (true);
            }

            void shutdown() override
            {
                myMainWindow = nullptr;
            }

            const String getApplicationName() override
            {
                return "Super JUCE-o-matic";
            }

            const String getApplicationVersion() override
            {
                return "1.0";
            }

        private:
            std::unique_ptr<MyApplicationWindow> myMainWindow;
        };

        // this generates boilerplate code to launch our app class:
        START_JUCE_APPLICATION (MyJUCEApp)
    @endcode

        their changes before quitting, and give them the chance to cancel.

        If you want to send a quit signal to your app, this is the correct method
        to call, because it means that requests that come from the system get handled
        in the same way as those from your own application code. So e.g. you'd
