    Because it's not thread-safe to call any of the Component or other UI classes
    from threads other than the message thread, one of these objects can be used to
    lock the message loop and allow this to be done. The message thread will be
    suspended for the lifetime of the MessageManagerLock object, so create one on
    the stack like this: @code
    void MyThread::run()
    {
        someData = 1234;

        const MessageManagerLock mmLock;
        // the event loop will now be locked so it's safe to make a few calls..

        myComponent->repaint();

        // ..the event loop will now be unlocked as the MessageManagerLock goes out of scope
    }
    @endcode

    Obviously be careful not to create one of these and leave it lying around, or
    your app will grind to a halt!

    MessageManagerLocks are re-entrant, so can be safely nested if the current thread
    already has the lock.

    Another caveat is that using this in conjunction with other CriticalSections
    can create lots of interesting ways of producing a deadlock! In particular, if
    your message thread calls stopThread() for a thread that uses these locks,
    you'll get an (occasional) deadlock..

    /** Tries to acquire a lock on the message manager.

        The constructor attempts to gain a lock on the message loop, and the lock will be
        kept for the lifetime of this object.

        Optionally, you can pass a thread object here, and while waiting to obtain the lock,
        this method will keep checking whether the thread has been given the
        Thread::signalThreadShouldExit() signal. If this happens, then it will return
        without gaining the lock. If you pass a thread, you must check whether the lock was
        successful by calling lockWasGained(). If this is false, your thread is being told to
        die, so you should take evasive action.

        If you pass nullptr for the thread object, it will wait indefinitely for the lock - be
        careful when doing this, because it's very easy to deadlock if your message thread
        attempts to call stopThread() on a thread just as that thread attempts to get the
        message lock.

        If the calling thread already has the lock, nothing will be done, so it's safe and
