    /** Manages a set of ChildProcesses and periodically checks their return value. Upon completion
        it calls listeners added with addChildProcessExitedListener().

        This class is mostly aimed for usage on Linux, where terminated child processes are only
        cleaned up if their return code is read after termination. In order to ensure this one needs
        to call ChildProcess::isFinished() until it returns false or
        ChildProcess::waitForProcessToFinish() until it returns true.

        This class will keep querying the return code on a Timer thread until the process
        terminates. This can be handy if one wants to start and stop multiple ChildProcesses on
        Linux that could take a long time to complete.

        Since this class uses a Timer to check subprocess status, it's generally only safe to
        access the returned ChildProcesses from the message thread.

            return value has been queried. Calling ChildProcess::kill() on the returned object will
            eventually cause its removal from the ChildProcessManager after it terminates.
