/**
    A base class for top-level windows that can be dragged around and resized.

    To add content to the window, use its setContentOwned() or setContentNonOwned() methods
    to give it a component that will remain positioned inside it (leaving a gap around
    the edges for a border).

    It's not advisable to add child components directly to a ResizableWindow: put them
    inside your content component instead. And overriding methods like resized(), moved(), etc
    is also not recommended - instead override these methods for your content component.
    (If for some obscure reason you do need to override these methods, always remember to
    call the super-class's resized() method too, otherwise it'll fail to lay out the window
    decorations correctly).

    By default resizing isn't enabled - use the setResizable() method to enable it and
    to choose the style of resizing to use.
