    /** Shows a dialog box with three buttons.

        Ideal for yes/no/cancel boxes.

        The escape key can be used to trigger the third button.

        If JUCE_MODAL_LOOPS_PERMITTED is not defined or the callback parameter is non-null,
        this function will return immediately. The object passed as the callback argument will
        receive the result of the alert window asynchronously.
        Otherwise, if JUCE_MODAL_LOOPS_PERMITTED is defined and the callback parameter is null,
        the box is shown modally, and the method will block until the user has clicked the button
        (or pressed the escape or return keys). This mode of operation can cause problems,
        especially in plugins, so it is not recommended.

        @param iconType     the type of icon to show
        @param title        the headline to show at the top of the box

                            headline
        @param button1Text  the text to show in the first button - if an empty string, then
                            "yes" will be used (or a localised version of it)
        @param button2Text  the text to show in the first button - if an empty string, then
                            "no" will be used (or a localised version of it)
        @param button3Text  the text to show in the first button - if an empty string, then
                            "cancel" will be used (or a localised version of it)
        @param associatedComponent   if this is non-null, it specifies the component that the
                            alert window should be associated with. Depending on the look
                            and feel, this might be used for positioning of the alert window.
        @param callback     if this is non-null, the menu will be launched asynchronously,
                            returning immediately, and the callback will receive a call to its
                            modalStateFinished() when the box is dismissed, with its parameter
                            being 1 if the "yes" button was pressed, 2 for the "no" button, or 0
                            if it was cancelled. The callback object will be owned and deleted by the
                            system, so make sure that it works safely and doesn't keep any references
                            to objects that might be deleted before it gets called.

        @returns If the callback parameter has been set, this returns 0. Otherwise, it
                 returns one of the following values:
                 - 0 if the third button was pressed (normally used for 'cancel')
                 - 1 if the first button was pressed (normally used for 'yes')
                 - 2 if the middle button was pressed (normally used for 'no')
