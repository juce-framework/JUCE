/**
    A resizable window with a title bar and maximise, minimise and close buttons.

    This subclass of ResizableWindow creates a fairly standard type of window with
    a title bar and various buttons. The name of the component is shown in the
    title bar, and an icon can optionally be specified with setIcon().

    All the methods available to a ResizableWindow are also available to this,
    so it can easily be made resizable, minimised, maximised, etc.

    It's not advisable to add child components directly to a DocumentWindow: put them
    inside your content component instead. And overriding methods like resized(), moved(), etc
    is also not recommended - instead override these methods for your content component.
    (If for some obscure reason you do need to override these methods, always remember to
    call the super-class's resized() method too, otherwise it'll fail to lay out the window
    decorations correctly).

    You can also automatically add a menu bar to the window, using the setMenuBar()
    method.
