/**
    An item in a treeview.

    A TreeViewItem can either be a leaf-node in the tree, or it can contain its
    own sub-items.

    To implement an item that contains sub-items, override the itemOpennessChanged()
    method so that when it is opened, it adds the new sub-items to itself using the
    addSubItem method. Depending on the nature of the item it might choose to only
    do this the first time it's opened, or it might want to refresh itself each time.
    It also has the option of deleting its sub-items when it is closed, or leaving them
    in place.

        the TreeView that created it. This is perfectly safe, and there's no danger
        of it becoming a dangling pointer because the TreeView will always delete
        the component before it is itself deleted.
