/**
    A slider control for changing a value.

    The slider can be horizontal, vertical, or rotary, and can optionally have
    a text-box inside it to show an editable display of the current value.

    To use it, create a Slider object and use the setSliderStyle() method
    to set up the type you want. To set up the text-entry box, use setTextBoxStyle().

    To define the values that it can be set to, see the setRange() and setValue() methods.

    There are also lots of custom tweaks you can do by subclassing and overriding
    some of the virtual methods, such as changing the scaling, changing the format of
    the text display, custom ways of limiting the values, etc.

    You can register Slider::Listener objects with a slider, and they'll be called when
    the value changes.
