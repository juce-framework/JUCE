/**
    Controls the order in which focus moves between components.

    The algorithm used by this class to work out the order of traversal is as
    follows:
    - Only visible and enabled components are considered focusable.
    - If two components both have an explicit focus order specified then the
      one with the lowest number comes first (see the
      Component::setExplicitFocusOrder() method).
    - Any component with an explicit focus order greater than 0 comes before ones
      that don't have an order specified.
    - Components with their 'always on top' flag set come before those without.
    - Any unspecified components are traversed in a left-to-right, then
      top-to-bottom order.

    If you need focus traversal in a more customised way you can create a
    ComponentTraverser subclass that uses your own algorithm and return it
    from Component::createFocusTraverser().
