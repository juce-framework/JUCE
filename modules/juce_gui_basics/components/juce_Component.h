        It then runs a loop, dispatching messages from the system message queue, but

        Note that you SHOULD NEVER USE THIS METHOD! Modal loops are a dangerous construct
        because things that happen during the events that they dispatch could affect the
        state of objects which are currently in use somewhere on the stack, so when the

    /** Override this method to return a custom AccessibilityHandler for this component.

        The default implementation creates and returns a AccessibilityHandler object with an
        unspecified role, meaning that it will be visible to accessibility clients but
        without a specific role, action callbacks or interfaces. To control how accessibility
        clients see and interact with your component subclass AccessibilityHandler, implement
        the desired behaviours, and return an instance of it from this method in your
        component subclass.

        The accessibility handler you return here is guaranteed to be destroyed before
        its Component, so it's safe to store and use a reference back to the Component
        inside the AccessibilityHandler if necessary.

        This function should rarely be called directly. If you need to query a component's
        accessibility handler, it's normally better to call getAccessibilityHandler().
        The exception to this rule is derived implementations of createAccessibilityHandler(),
        which may find it useful to call the base class implementation, and then wrap or
        modify the result.
