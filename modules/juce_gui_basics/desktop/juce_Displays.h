            On mobile (iOS, Android), the system UI will be made transparent whenever possible, and
            the JUCE app may draw behind these bars. Therefore, on these platforms, the userArea
            is *not* restricted by the system UI. Instead, potentially-obscured areas of the
            display can be found by querying the safeAreaInsets and keyboardInsets.

            Mobile platforms that support multiple windows (e.g. Android in split screen) will
            return the screen area currently available to the application here. The resulting
            area may be significantly smaller than the total screen area, but may overlap the

            On mobile devices this may be the area covered by display cutouts and notches, where
            you still want to draw a background but should not position important content.

            Note that these insets may change depending on the current state of the system.
            As a simple example, entering/leaving kiosk mode may cause the system UI visibility
            to change, which may affect the safe areas.
            A more complex example would be split-screen state on Android, where an activity
            occupying the top portion of the screen is likely to have insets for the status bar but
            not the navigation bar, whereas an activity on the bottom may have navigation insets
            but not status insets.

            The insets may also change as a result of rotating the screen, as this will rotate any
            physical screen cutouts, and could also cause system UI elements to be repositioned.
