/**
    Manages the state of some audio and midi i/o devices.

    This class keeps tracks of a currently-selected audio device, through
    with which it continuously streams data from an audio callback, as well as
    one or more midi inputs.

    The idea is that your application will create one global instance of this object,
    and let it take care of creating and deleting specific types of audio devices
    internally. So when the device is changed, your callbacks will just keep running
    without having to worry about this.

    The manager can save and reload all of its device settings as XML, which
    makes it very easy for you to save and reload the audio setup of your
    application.

    And to make it easy to let the user change its settings, there's a component
    to do just that - the AudioDeviceSelectorComponent class, which contains a set of
    device selection/sample-rate/latency controls.

    To use an AudioDeviceManager, create one, and use initialise() to set it up. Then
    call addAudioCallback() to register your audio callback with it, and use that to process
    your audio data.

    The manager also acts as a handy hub for incoming midi messages, allowing a
    listener to register for messages from either a specific midi device, or from whatever
    the current default midi input device is. The listener then doesn't have to worry about
    re-registering with different midi devices if they are changed or deleted.

    And yet another neat trick is that amount of CPU time being used is measured and
    available with the getCpuUsage() method.

    The AudioDeviceManager is a ChangeBroadcaster, and will send a change message to
    listeners whenever one of its settings is changed.
