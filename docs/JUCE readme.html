<h1>JUCE</h1>

<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>JUCE is an all-encompassing C++ class
library for developing cross-platform applications.</p>

<p>A complete doxygen-created API guide is available <a href="http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce/api/index.html" target="juce api">here</a> 
as HTML, or can be downloaded as a precompiled Windows help file from the 
<a href="http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce/download.php">downloads</a> page.</p>

<p>For more help and information, please visit the <a href="http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce">JUCE website</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="license"></a>License</h2>

<p>JUCE is released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">Gnu Public License</a>, 
which means it can be freely copied and distributed, and costs nothing to use in open-source applications.</p>
<p>If you'd like to release a closed-source application that uses JUCE, commercial licenses are available 
for a fee - click <a href="http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce/licensing.php">here</a> for more information on pricing and terms.</p>

<h2><a name="install"></a>Installation</h2>

<h3>Installing the source code</h3>

<p>The JUCE source code all lives in a folder called, unsurprisingly, <code>juce</code>, which you can unzip 
and put somewhere on your system.</p>

<p>To compile the library, there is a subfolder <code>juce/build</code> that contains projects for different 
operating systems and compilers.</p>

<h3>Building the demo application</h3>

<p>Inside the <code>juce</code> folder is a demo application that shows off a few of Juce's features. 
The <code>juce/extras/juce demo/build</code> folder contains projects and workspaces for the various platforms and compilers.</p>

<h2>Building your application with JUCE</h2>

<h3><a name="buildvc2005"></a>Compiling with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005</h3>

<p>The quickest way to get started is to try building the demo application - there's a Visual Studio
soluion in <code>juce/extras/juce demo/build/win32_vc8/jucedemo.sln</code> which contains both the juce 
library project and the demo application project.</p>
<p>This should build and run with no extra set-up needed in Visual Studio. (If you're using VCExpress Edition
see below for the few extra steps needed).</p>
<p>The only thing to check if you're unfamiliar with Visual Studio is that the <code>jucedemo</code> 
project needs to be selected as your "startup" project (right-click on the 
jucedemo project in the solution explorer for this option). Also, the active configuration should be
set to "Debug" or "Release", (the first time you load a project, VS selects one of the configurations and 
usually picks "Debug DLL" as its default, for reasons best known to itself).</p>

<p>To create your own application that links to Juce:</p>
<ol>
<li>Either make a copy of the example project in <code>juce/projects</code> and rename/customise 
it, or create a new application project as an 'empty' WIN32 application - avoid saying yes to 
MFC or any of the other rubbish that Visual Studio might offer to pollute your application with.</li>
<li>Include the header file <code>juce.h</code> in all your source files (it's best to
put this in a precompiled header).</li>
<li>Ensure that the linker's search path for libraries includes the the <code>juce/bin</code> directory.
This path can be set globally, or can be added to your project's linker settings.</li>
<li>Choose to link to the "Multithreaded" or "Debug Multithreaded" run-time libraries, depending on
whether you're doing a debug or release build. On VC6, this is set in the Project Settings / C/C++ / Code
Generation options panel. In Visual Studio, it's in the project properties.</li>
<li>Make sure that your project has exception handling and run-time type information (RTTI) turned ON.</li>
<li>Have a look at the 'hello world' projects, demo projects, or the API documentation about the 
<code>JUCEApplication</code> class to find out how to create the application launch code.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="buildvcx"></a>Compiling with Microsoft Visual C++ Express edition</h3>

<p>Although VCExpress is basically the same thing as Visual Studio 2005, it doesn't come
with all the Win32 library code pre-installed, so a couple of extra steps are required before JUCE
can be compiled with it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install the latest Platform SDK from Microsoft.</li>
<li>A few extra items need to be added to your include and library search paths. The first few 
entries on your include path should look like this (obviously you might have things installed in 
different places, but the order is important!):
<pre>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\include
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\include\crt
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\include\mfc
C:\mycode\juce
...</pre>
And the library search path should begin like this:
<pre>$(VSInstallDir)VC\lib
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\lib
C:\mycode\juce\bin
...</pre>
</li>
</ol>
    
<p>Then, you can follow the same instructions as for Visual Studio 2005 above.</p>

<h3><a name="buildvc6"></a>Compiling with Microsoft Visual Studio 6</h3>

<p>To compile the JUCE .lib files from the source code:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install the latest Platform SDK from Microsoft.</li>
<li>Set up your include and library search paths. The first few items on your include path 
should look like this (obviously you might have things installed in different places, but the 
order is important!):
<pre>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\include
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\include\crt
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\include\mfc
C:\mycode\juce
...</pre>
And the library search path should begin like this:
<pre>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\LIB
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\lib
C:\mycode\juce\bin
...</pre>
</li>
<li>Open the juce.dsp project file in <code>juce/build/win32/vc6</code></li>
<li>There are several configurations: debug, release, debug-unicode, and release-unicode. 
You can build all or some of these, and the resultant .lib files should end up in the 
"juce/bin" folder.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that there's a rather lame bug in VC6 that causes an internal compiler error if you include
filenames that are too long. This can get triggered if you put the juce folder in a deeply-nested
directory (such as your user home directory). Unfortunately I think the only workaround for this 
is to move the source tree to a shallower directory.</p>

<p>For info on how to create an application that uses Juce, see the VC2005 notes above.</p>

<h3><a name="buildvc7"></a>Compiling with Microsoft Visual Studio 7</h3>

<p>For VC7, you can import the VC6 projects and this should work ok. It's also possible to
tweak the version number in the VC8 projects so that they can be opened in VC7, but that's a 
less reliable method!</p>

<h3><a name="buildxcode"></a>Compiling with XCode on MacOSX</h3>

<p>To compile the JUCE binaries from the source code:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the <code>Juce.xcodeproj</code> file in <code>juce/build/macosx</code></li>
<li>This project has "debug" and "release" configurations, and the library files it creates
are <code>libjuce.a</code> (release) and <code>libjucedebug.a</code> (debug), which will appear 
in the <code>juce/bin</code> directory.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then, to create and build an application:</p>

<ol>
<li>Either make a copy of the example project in <code>juce/extras/example projects</code> and rename/customise it, or
create a new "Carbon Application" project.</li>
<li>Include the header file <code>juce.h</code> in all your source files.</li>
<li>Get rid of any main() functions that XCode might have generated for you, and instead use the 
<code>JUCEApplication</code> class as your application launcher - see the API documentation for this 
class for more details, or have a look at the example projects, or demos.</li>
<li>Drag-and-drop the <code>juce.xcodeproj</code> file into the project's "External Frameworks and Libraries" 
list.</li>
<li>Expand this item in the treeview, and inside there'll be an item "libjuce.a" or "libjucedebug.a" - drag-and-drop
this into the "link binary with libraries" phase inside the xcode target. When you select either a debug
or release juce build these entries will (usually) update themselves to show the correct debug or release library
name. If you want your project to automatically rebuild Juce when you make changes to a juce file, you can 
also add Juce to your target's "Direct Dependency" list (show information for the target, and this is on the 
"general" tab).<br/>Alternative ways of linking to juce would be to add the libjuce.a or libjucedebug.a library to
your "External Frameworks and Libraries" list, or to add switch to the linker's command-line of either "-ljuce" 
or "-ljucedebug".</li>
<li>You'll also need to add some of the following OSX frameworks to your "External Frameworks and Libraries" list,
depending on what features your application uses:
<pre>Carbon.framework
IOKit.framework
CoreAudio.framework
CoreMIDI.framework
QuickTime.framework
OpenGL.framework
AGL.framework</pre>
In future there may be other frameworks that you'll need to link with to support new JUCE features. 
(It should be pretty obvious from the link-time error when one of these is missing).
</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="builddevcpp"></a>Creating a JUCE application with Dev-C++</h3>
<ol>
<li>open <code>\juce\build\win32\devcpp\juce.dev</code></li>
<li>You may need to install the Platform SDK from Microsoft, and add <pre>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Include</pre>
at the <strong>end</strong> of your include path to get some of the more recent header files.</li>
<li>Compile! It should produce a library file called <code>juce/bin/libjuce.a</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Then, to create and build an application:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new project, as a "win32 GUI".</li>
<li>Remove <code>main.cpp</code></li>
<li>Either copy the example main.cpp from the MSVC juce example project, or write your own based
around the <code>JUCEApplication</code> class</li>
<li>In your project settings (alt-P), you'll need to adjust the linker's options so that it links the following libraries:
<pre>libjuce.a (this will be in your juce/bin/ directory)
libwininet.a
libdsound.a
libole32.a
libwinmm.a
libgdi32.a
libuuid.a
libshell32.a
libvfw32.a
librpcrt4.a (these are all in the Dev-C++ libraries folder)</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="buildlinux"></a>Creating a JUCE application on Linux with GCC</h3>

<ol>
<li>Most linux distros should come with the tools you need, although you might want to get hold of 
<a href="http://premake.sourceforge.net/">premake</a>, which is used to automatically generate the
juce makefile. (This isn't necessary if you're just going to use the makefile that's provided).</li>
<li>Get a command prompt and go into <code>/juce/build/linux</code></li>
<li>To build the debug version, use "<code>make CONFIG=Debug</code>", or use "<code>make CONFIG=Release</code>" 
to build the release version. You can also use "<code>make clean</code>" to delete the intermediate 
files.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then, to create and build an application:</p>
<ol>
<li>Building the library will have produced the library files <code>/juce/bin/libjuce.a</code> and
<code>/juce/bin/libjuce_debug.a</code>. You'll need to link to one of these in your app, and you'll 
also need to link to these libraries:
<pre>freetype
pthread
X11</pre>
If you've set the <code>JUCE_USE_XINERAMA</code> flag in juce_Config.h, you'll also need to link to the 
<code>xinerama</code> library.
And you'll need the <code>GL</code> and <code>GLU</code> libraries if you've enabled 
<code>JUCE_OPENGL</code>
</li>
</ol>
