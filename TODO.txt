WS Patches on bank change

M1 Problem - Set defaults (My combi's and patches, midi channel 16), Send 
New internal plugin that filters MIDI (Replaces JACK stuff)
Non standard MIDI commands
Transition Keylab Sysex to JUCE Midi Out (Will only work on device)
Chunk saving (M1 needs program mode - Could be a problem and mean we have to use them in combi mode with control channel 16, OPX Famous bank, DirectWave setup, Wavstreamer setup)
Add octave mode
Check sampler supports octave mode
Master volume - new plugin
Mono switch (simply doesn't mix TruePianos)

Import command hooked up - Reimport, make sure unused banks are -1
Song change - Check resends Bank/Program
Saving - Check muted zones dont save
Setlist manager

Scoops/Falls for disco strings
TruePianos crash
Maybe support for M1 Combi (Show must go on)
